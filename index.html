            <p class="story-text1"> Daniel and Sienna met in 2019 when they were juniors at UNC- Chapel Hill. They were both members of trivia teams that competed at local bars throughout the week. Daniel and Sienna’s teams were often competitors for the winning title and got to know each other through their trivia rivalry. Daniel eventually asked Sienna out for coffee and they hit it off! After graduation, Daniel proposed to Sienna and they started their new chapters together. They recently got a dog named Milo and are loving having him as a new family member. They are so excited to solidify their love forever and share their special day with you!</p>

Please avoid shorts, jeans, and sneakers if possible. But most importantly, wear something that allows for fun on the dance floor!</p>
